# Extra Resources for APSC 174

Dont worry if youre feeling lost in APSC 174, all of the profs are bad. These resources will be provided as a way of augmenting our learning in ways that *hopefully* make more sense than the lectures we are given. 

Organised by Section as arranged in the lecture notes.

If you want more in a particular topic, or have resources to share, post in the issues tab or send me an email at [my email](mailto:22lxj1@queensu.ca)

**This is not a replacemnt of attending lectures!!** There is material that is covered in class that is so weird and niche that I wont be able to find resources for it.

## General Resources
* [MIT OpenCourseWare: 18.06SC](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/)
  * This not only has lectures from Gilbert Strang, one of the most well known and highly regarded Linear Algebra Profs of all time, but practice problems, recitations (like a tutorial), and practice exams (all with solutions and expanations of the process)
* [3Blue1Brown: Essence of Linear Algebra](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&si=a3Iv4Xm85umd5VaF)
