# Extra Resources for APSC 174

Dont worry if youre feeling lost in APSC 174, all of the profs are bad. These resources will be provided as a way of augmenting our learning in ways that *hopefully* make more sense than the lectures we are given. 

***This is not a replacement of attending lectures!!*** There is material that is covered in class that is so weird and niche that I won't be able to find resources for it.

Organised by section in the lecture notes.

If you want more on a particular topic, or have resources to share, post in the discussion tab or, if you're really desperate, send me an email at [my email](mailto:22lxj1@queensu.ca)

## General Resources
* [Linear Algebra 4th Edition](https://ia804704.us.archive.org/22/items/linear-algibra-4th-edition-by-friedberg/Linear%20Algibra%204th%20edition%20by%20Friedberg.pdf)
  * The textbook for this course, useful if you skip lectures, but once again, probably not a complete replacement.
  * Solutions to problems can be found at the back of the textbook, but more slightly more detailed answers can be found [HERE](https://jlch3554.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/la-solution-2011-7.pdf)

* [MIT OpenCourseWare: 18.06SC](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/)
  * This doesnt cover ALL of 174, there's a few weird things in APSC 174 that 18.06SC doesn't cover, but overall it seems to cover most of it.
  * This not only has lectures from Gilbert Strang, one of the most well known and highly regarded Linear Algebra Profs of all time, but practice problems, recitations (like a tutorial), and practice exams (all with solutions and expanations of the process)
* [3Blue1Brown: Essence of Linear Algebra](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&si=a3Iv4Xm85umd5VaF)
  * A great math youtube channel in general, and this series provides excelent visualizations of some of the weirder concepts.
* [Khan Academy | Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)
  * If you dont know Khan Academy, you should, they're great. Not sure how close their course is to 174, but there may be a few usefull practice problems on there
* [Kimberly Brehm | Linear Agebra (Entire Course)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII03hiCrZa7YqxUMEeEPmZqK&si=IidBIq97HmHjQie8)
  * I haven't looked very far into this one, but according to a Sci 26, it has "similar content" although it's "in a bit of a different order"
* [Wikipedia | Linear Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra)
  * Wikipedia can often be dense, technical, and often goes beyond what we will learn in 174, so it may not help a ton, however, it is written in the same language as 174, and may aid in clearing things up
 

## Section 0
Set Notation

Mappings


## Section 1
Systems of Linear Equations

## Section 2
Real Vector Spaces

* [Kimberly Brehm | Vector Spaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMwwplztQfY) - has lots of good practice questions
* [3Blue1Brown | Abstract Vector Spaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgKwz5Ikpc8) - this isnt *exactly* what we're learning, and it's a bit beyond where we are right now, but it's similar
* [LibreTexts | 4.1: DeÔ¨Ånition of vector spaces](https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Linear_Algebra/Book%3A_Linear_Algebra_(Schilling_Nachtergaele_and_Lankham)/04%3A_Vector_spaces/4.01%3A_De%EF%AC%81nition_of_vector_spaces#:~:text=A%20vector%20space%20over%20R%20is%20usually%20called,V%20of%20a%20vector%20space%20are%20called%20vectors.)
