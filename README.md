# Extra Resources for APSC 174

Dont worry if youre feeling lost in APSC 174, all of the profs are bad. These resources will be provided as a way of augmenting our learning in ways that *hopefully* make more sense than the lectures we are given. 

***This is not a replacemnt of attending lectures!!*** There is material that is covered in class that is so weird and niche that I will not be able to find resources for it.

Organised by section in the lecture notes.

If you want more on a particular topic, or have resources to share, post in the discussion tab or if you're really desperate, send me an email at [my email](mailto:22lxj1@queensu.ca)

## General Resources
* [MIT OpenCourseWare: 18.06SC](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/)
  * This doesnt cover ALL of 174, theres a few weird things in APSC 174 that 18.06SC doesn't cover, but overall it seems to cover most of it.
  * This not only has lectures from Gilbert Strang, one of the most well known and highly regarded Linear Algebra Profs of all time, but practice problems, recitations (like a tutorial), and practice exams (all with solutions and expanations of the process)
* [3Blue1Brown: Essence of Linear Algebra](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&si=a3Iv4Xm85umd5VaF)
  * A great math youtube channel in general, and this series provides excelent visualizations of some of the weirder concepts.
* [Khan Academy | Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)
  * If you dont know Khan Academy, you should, they're great. Not sure how close their course is to 174, but there may be a few usefull practice problems on there
* [Kimberly Brehm | Linear Agebra (Entire Course)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII03hiCrZa7YqxUMEeEPmZqK&si=IidBIq97HmHjQie8)
  * I haven't looked very far into this one, but according to a Sci 26, it has "similar content" although it's "in a bit of a different order"
* [Wikipedia | Linear Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra)
  * Wikipedia can often be dense, technical, and often goes beyond what we will learn in 174, so it may not help a ton, however, it is written in the same language as 174, and may clear up a few things
