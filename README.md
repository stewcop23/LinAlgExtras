# Extra Resources for APSC 174

Dont worry if youre feeling lost in APSC 174, all of the profs are bad. These resources will be provided as a way of augmenting our learning in ways that *hopefully* make more sense than the lectures we are given. 

***This is not a replacement of attending lectures!!*** There is material that is covered in class that is so weird and niche that I won't be able to find resources for it.

Organised by section in the lecture notes.

If you want more on a particular topic, or have resources to share, post in the discussion tab or, if you're really desperate, send me an email at [my email](mailto:22lxj1@queensu.ca)

## Ableson's Lectures:
Ableson has posted recorded lectures! They're very good, I would recomend watching them if you're stuck.

## General Resources
* [Linear Algebra 4th Edition](https://ia804704.us.archive.org/22/items/linear-algibra-4th-edition-by-friedberg/Linear%20Algibra%204th%20edition%20by%20Friedberg.pdf)
  * The textbook for this course, useful if you skip lectures, but once again, probably not a complete replacement.
  * Solutions to problems can be found at the back of the textbook, but more slightly more detailed answers can be found [HERE](https://jlch3554.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/la-solution-2011-7.pdf)

* [MIT OpenCourseWare: 18.06SC](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/)
  * This doesnt cover ALL of 174, there's a few weird things in APSC 174 that 18.06SC doesn't cover, but overall it seems to cover most of it.
  * This not only has lectures from Gilbert Strang, one of the most well known and highly regarded Linear Algebra Profs of all time, but practice problems, recitations (like a tutorial), and practice exams (all with solutions and expanations of the process)
* [3Blue1Brown: Essence of Linear Algebra](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&si=a3Iv4Xm85umd5VaF)
  * A great math youtube channel in general, and this series provides excelent visualizations of some of the weirder concepts.
* [Khan Academy | Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)
  * If you dont know Khan Academy, you should, they're great. Not sure how close their course is to 174, but there may be a few usefull practice problems on there
* [Kimberly Brehm | Linear Agebra (Entire Course)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII03hiCrZa7YqxUMEeEPmZqK&si=IidBIq97HmHjQie8)
  * I haven't looked very far into this one, but according to a Sci 26, it has "similar content" although it's "in a bit of a different order"
* [Dr. Trefor Bazett](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHXZ9OQGMqxfUl0tcqPNTJsb7R6BqSLo6)
  * Seems like it has plenty of good examples that relate to topics were covering
* [Wikipedia | Linear Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra)
  * Wikipedia can often be dense, technical, and often goes beyond what we will learn in 174, so it may not help a ton, however, it is written in the same language as 174, and may aid in clearing things up

## Section 6 - "Applications of Systems of Linear Equations"
This section boils down to asking: "how many solutions are there to: $w = \alpha_1 v_1 + \alpha_2v_2 +...\alpha_pv_p$?

The answer to this question is another question:

Is $w\in Span_{v_1,v_2,...,v_p}$? 

No? Then there are no solutions. 

Yes? Now, are $v_1,v_2,...,v_p$ dependant or independant?

Independant? There is only one solution 

Dependant? There is infinitely many solutions.

## Section 8 & 9 - Generating Sets and Bases, Finite Dimensional Bases 

A generating set for the RVS, $V$, is a set of vectors $v_1,v_2,...,v_p$ $\in V$ where $V$ is the span of ${v_1,v_2,...,v_p}$.

A basis for $V$ is a generating set for $V$ that is also linearly independant. And for a finite-dimensional basis, dim($V$) = minimum number of vectors required to form a basis for $V$.
